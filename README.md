# OpenSAGE.FFmpeg

A repository that contains a minimal FFmpeg build that contains all the Codecs required by OpenSage. 
For wrapping the native libraries we are using a modified version of [FFmpeg.Autogen](https://github.com/Ruslan-B/FFmpeg.AutoGen).
The library exposes a high level interface to the media functionality.
